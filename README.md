# Cards Against Humanity Api

This is an api for my Cards Against Humanity online implementation and soon will be just and api for fetching CAH cards and decks.

# Run locally

Install deps:

```
npm i
```

run locally:
```
npm run start
```

Note: It may have a problem with the ports already being used so u will have to kill proces manually sometimes
